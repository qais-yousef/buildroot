	  BPFTrace

	  bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced
	  Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux
	  kernels (4.x).

	  bpftrace uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to
	  BPF-bytecode and makes use of BCC for interacting with the
	  Linux BPF system, as well as existing Linux tracing
	  capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes), user-level
	  dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints. The bpftrace
	  language is inspired by awk and C, and predecessor tracers
	  such as DTrace and SystemTap.
