	  BPF Compiler Collection

	  BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and
	  manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and
	  examples.

	  BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel
	  instrumentation in C (and includes a C wrapper around LLVM),
	  and front-ends in Python and lua. It is suited for many tasks,
	  including performance analysis and network traffic control.
